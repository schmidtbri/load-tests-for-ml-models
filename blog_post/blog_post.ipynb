A common requirement for RESTful services is to be able to be able to continue working while being used by many users at the same time. In this blog post we'll show how to create a load testing script for an ML model service."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying machine learning models is always done in the context of a bigger software system into which the ML model is being integrated. ML models need to be integrated correctly into the software system, and the deployed ML model needs to meet the requirements of the system into which it is being deployed. The requirements that a system must meet are often categorized into two types: functional requirements and non-functional requirements. [Functional requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_requirement) are the specific behavior that a sytem must have in order to do its assigned tasks. [Non-functional requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement) are the operational standards that the system must meet in order to do its assigned tasks. An example of a non-functional requirement is resilience, which is the quality of a system that is able to have errors in its operation and still provide an acceptable level of service. Non-functional requirements are often hard to measure objectively, but we can definitely tell when they are missing from a system. In this blog post we'll be dealing with load non-functional requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-functional requirements can be stated by using [Service Level Indicators (SLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_level_indicator). An SLI is a simply a metric that measures an aspect of the function of the system. For example, the latency of a system is the amount of time it takes for the system to fulfill one request from beginning to end. An SLI needs to be well-defined and understood by both the clients and operators of a system because it forms the basis for service level objectives. Some examples of SLIs are latency, throughput, availability, error rate, and durability.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Service level objectives (SLO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_objective) are requirements on the operation of a system as measured through the SLIs of the system. SLOs are defined and agreed-upon ways to tell when a system is operating outside of the required performance standard. For example, when measuring latency a valid SLO would be something like this: \"the latency of the system must be 500 ms or less for 90% of requests\". When measuring error rates an SLO would say \"the number of errors must not exceed 10 for every 10,000 requests made to the system\".\n",
    "\n",
    "[Service Level Agreements (SLA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement) are an agreement between a system and its clients about the \"level\" at which the system will provide its services. SLAs can contain many different types of clauses, the ones we are interested today are the non-functional aspects of the system as measured by SLIs and constrained by SLOs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Load testing is the process by which we can verify that a deployed ML model that is deployed as a service is able to meet the SLA of the service while under load. Some of the SLIs that we will me measuring will be latency, throughput, and error rate.\n",

We also showed how to add a shape to the load test in order to simplify load testing and how to add SLOs to the load testing script so that we can quickly tell if the model and model service are able to meet the requirements of the deployment. Lastly, we deployed the model service to a Kubernetes and showed how to implement autoscaling so that the model service can meet the SLO adaptively."
